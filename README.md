## API-Challenge
In this project, we analyzed weather data for over 500 cities using Python. In Part 1 (WeatherPy), we created scatter plots to explore the relationship between weather variables and latitude, separated by the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We also performed linear regression and included the model's formula and r-values on the plots.

In Part 2 (VacationPy), we used the weather data to help plan vacations. We visualized the cities on a map with points sized by humidity and filtered the data based on ideal weather conditions. We then created a new DataFrame with city details and used the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels within 10,000 meters, adding hotel information to the map for each city.
